ANSWER 1
user defined data types (structures) are of great use as they help us group different 
types of data together like the struct i used in the code of workshop 7
struct PlayerInfo // making a user defined data type PlayerInfo
	{
		int livecnt;
		char plyricon;
		int foundtreasercnt;
		int PastEntrdPos[MAXPATHLENGTH];
	};
is storing character values and integer values together under a name of player object.
hence data handling becomes easy.
so once we define this stuct we do not need to make 4 different variables again and again
we can just use this structure to make a data type of this specifiation like player 
we can make many.

ANSWER 2
there are various things we can do like we can make array of this user defined data type and store 
all the values in different index of the stucture it would be of great help because that we 
would have a lot of variables stored under a name
struct PlayerInfo // making a user defined data type PlayerInfo
	{
		int livecnt;
		char plyricon;
		int foundtreasercnt;
		int PastEntrdPos[MAXPATHLENGTH];
	};
struct PlayerInfo player[5];// like this
to store the result we can make other array where all the results would be stored like how 
many treasures were found.

ANSWER 3 
the logic part of the program itself was moderate but thre was a lot of things in the program which
we neede to take care off making it very difficult to find what thing we did where and when we want
to make correction it becomes boring and hencce not able to concerntrate on it however if somthing needs
to be mentioned then it was formulating the idea to print the output as

       V 
!-$-!--.-.----&----$

 i used dry run method and hence it took a very long time to me to figure it out.
