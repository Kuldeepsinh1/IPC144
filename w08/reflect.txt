Answer 1 
instead of passing the value of whole struct we can pass the address of the object
in the function by using this method we would not require to pass a lot of memory 
but just the memory required to store the address of the object will be used.
the minimum memory used to make a data type of the struct defined would be
(6 * memory taken by double dataata type) + (3 * memory taken by integer data type)
48 + 12 byte
minimum 60 bytes will be required but the packaging or padding done by the software will
add  more void spaces causing the number of bytes required to increase.

Answer 2
the members of ReportData and CatFoodInfo so what i could have done was while 
defining the structure for ReportData we could have put CatfoodInfo as a object
of it and it would have helped us as we would not be required to put four different
object while defining that structure. while printing we would have to write the following
printf("%d",ReportData.CatFoodInfo.sku); to print the value of sku asper my method.
and would only requie us to fill the value once for both the different struct.
