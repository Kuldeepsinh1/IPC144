ANSWER 1

to map the month number taken from user to the first three letter of the month
can be achieved by two different selection constructs that is if else and switch
case
	switch(month)
	{
		case 11:
           		printf("NOV");
           		break;
        	case 12:
                	printf("DEC");
            		break;
	}
variable month input from the user now if user enters 11 then it will print NOV

	if(month==11)
	{
		printf("NOV");
	}
	if(month==12)
	{
		printf("DEC");
	}
similar output as above will be yielded.

ANSWER 2

three types of iteration construct are for, while, do while.
the one used by me in my coding was do while and the reason behind using that is 
it is entry controlled and would run atleast once and then we change value of flag 
once the user enters correct input.for cannot be used because number of iterations
are supposed to be pre defined and we do not know how many tries the user will take
to enter the values in prescribed range.

ANSWER 3

for semantic error I used multiple printf statements as it helps precisely monitor 
the changes happening to the variable and it leads to find errors and correct our
our mistake.
dry run also is an effective method whhich helps to identify semantic error it helped 
me identify that i have to make a flag array to for using it make decisions for an array.
for syntatctic error the computer provides error code which upon searching on google
gives a appropriate reason for error and there are red indication also in visual studio
which suggests syntax error.
