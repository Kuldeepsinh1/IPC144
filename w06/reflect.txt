Answer 1

parallel arrays gives us a sense of connection between arrays when using them
and hence they are are very usefull. for instance in this particular workshop
we were supposed to make a total of values with similar priorities.
for (i = 0; i < noofitems; i++)
{
	if (priority[i] == filter)
      	{
          	 prioritytotalcost = prioritytotalcost + cost[i];
                  if (financing[i] == 'y')
                  {
                        flag1 = 0;
                  }
        }
}
here filter stores the value of the priority we need to make total cost off. both 
priority[] and cost[] array are independent arrays but the values are linked 
for example if priority is (1) of 2 diff elements then we will add those two 
different elements cost stored in diffrent array but at same index numbers hence the 
value of i will be same for both making it easy for us to do it in once with just one 
loop.

Answer 2

the reason behind iterating loop from zero is because the index numbers in array start
from zero.

for (i = 0; i < noofitems; i++)
{
	if (priority[i] == filter)
      	{
          	 prioritytotalcost = prioritytotalcost + cost[i];
                  if (financing[i] == 'y')
                  {
                        flag1 = 0;
                  }
        }
}
if the size of array is 3 then it will have 3 places but its address (index number) will 
be 0 , 1 and 2 so to get value of first element we have to enter zero in index number.
hence we start the loop from zero and because we start it from zero we run it it till
one less then array length.
here in the loop it is evident that we start from zero and the value of i is given in 
index number of various arrays.


Answer 3

I will tell the child that array is similar to a book shelf in which we can store just
one book per compartment of book shelf.
now because it is a book shelf we can just put books into it .i will tell this to explain
that similar things (values) can only be stored in a array. to tell for data type i will
explain the child that now to put clothes we need a wardrobe and cannot put in book shelf
so in a similar fashion we need to tell array first what we are going to store into it.

now going back to our original example of book shelf where each compartment can only store 
a book. now if we have 15 books we need to order a compartment which has fifteen shelfs
but the manufacturer starts naming from zero instead of one hence the shelfs are numbered from 
from 0 - 14 and not from 1 - 15.

to make the child practice i will tell the child i have 15 books numbered from 1 to 15
and put in the shelf from 0 - 14 shelf numbers and will tell the child to bring certain
books. this will teach child that if the child wants 13th book (13th element) then he has
to go to book shelf number 12 (index number 12).
